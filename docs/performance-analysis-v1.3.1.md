# WRPR v1.3.1 Performance Analysis

This document captures a code-level performance review of the Wisdom Rain PDF Reader (WRPR) v1.3.1 runtime. The review focused on render latency, fullscreen frames per second (FPS), memory usage, touch input delay, and resume validation.

## Render Latency

* **Safe-area computation caching** – `computeResponsiveScale` previously triggered a fresh `getComputedStyle` on every render which incurs a layout pass, especially when rapidly paging or resizing. A new cache now snapshots the safe-area insets and only refreshes when viewport-affecting events occur, preventing redundant style recalculations during steady-state rendering.【F:assets/js/wrpr-renderer.js†L32-L83】【F:assets/js/wrpr-renderer.js†L214-L229】
* **Render queue preservation** – The existing render queue and animation frame scheduling already provide sequential rendering without blocking the UI thread; no regressions were found. No code change required.【F:assets/js/wrpr-renderer.js†L136-L206】

## Fullscreen FPS

* **Fullscreen toggle responsiveness** – The fullscreen button now benefits from the fast interaction binding to avoid the synthetic click delay on touch hardware. Combined with the existing render queue, viewport recalculations now occur immediately after fullscreen transitions because safe-area caching is refreshed whenever fullscreen state changes.【F:assets/js/wrpr-renderer.js†L32-L83】【F:assets/js/wrpr-renderer.js†L233-L247】
* **Viewport updates** – Fullscreen events already invoke `handleViewportChange`, ensuring the canvas dimensions are resized to match the new fullscreen viewport. No additional changes were necessary.【F:assets/js/wrpr-renderer.js†L233-L247】

## Memory Usage

* **Resource teardown** – When the reader closes, existing logic destroys the PDF document, cancels pending tasks, and clears the canvas which remains sufficient for v1.3.1. No leaks were observed in the teardown sequence and no extra instrumentation was required.【F:assets/js/wrpr-renderer.js†L90-L133】

## Touch Input Delay

* **Pointer-optimized bindings** – Navigation, close, and fullscreen controls now use `bindFastAction`, invoking handlers on `pointerup`/`touchend` for touch and pen inputs while suppressing subsequent synthetic clicks. This removes the ~300 ms delay on mobile browsers without affecting mouse interactions.【F:assets/js/wrpr-renderer.js†L32-L83】【F:assets/js/wrpr-renderer.js†L209-L232】

## Resume Validation

* **Progress clamping** – The reader already clamps stored progress to the document’s page bounds before restoring, preventing resume into invalid pages. No change was required; validation remains adequate for v1.3.1.【F:assets/js/wrpr-renderer.js†L248-L276】

## Summary

Key touchpoints affecting perceived performance—specifically safe-area recomputation and touch interaction latency—have been hardened without altering the reader’s existing render pipeline or memory lifecycle. Remaining areas either already met performance expectations or did not show actionable regressions in this review.
